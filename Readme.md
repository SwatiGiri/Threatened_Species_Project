# A brief articulation of your chosen topic and rationale

How many species are threatened?
Species assessed as Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), or Vulnerable (VU) are referred to as "threatened" species.
Our project is to examine the number of  threatened species in different countries through a heat map.
Our project would focus on seeing a trend between the Terrestrial protected areas(% of total land area) and the endangered species.
A drop down list for looking at the different groups of endangered animals and their scatter plot on geomap.
